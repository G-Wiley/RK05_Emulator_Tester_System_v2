The Diablo Adapter P Keystone v2 is an adapter between the DEC dual 40-pin flat cable drive bus and the 42-pin connectors on the back of Diablo Series 30 disk drives. This adapter has pins so it plugs into the connector with sockets on the Diablo drive. The Diablo Terminator can be plugged into the Diablo Adapter that's attached to the last drive of the chain.
