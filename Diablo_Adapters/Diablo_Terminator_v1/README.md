The Diablo Terminator is plugged into either type of Diablo Adapter (pin or socket version) on the last drive of the chain. The terminator plugs into J1A and J2A of the Diablo Adapter. The connectors are keyed so the adapter can only be installed in the correct orientation. 
Since the terminator occupies two of the header locations on the Diablo Adapter, the other two headers on the Diablo Adapter, J1B and J2B, are the connection point for 40-pin flat cables that connect to either the previous drive in the daisy chain or to the disk controller.
