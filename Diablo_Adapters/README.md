Diablo Adapters and Terminator
The Diablo Adapters and Terminator are adapters between the DEC dual 40-pin flat cable drive bus and the 42-pin connectors on the back of Diablo Series 30 disk drives. A terminator was developed that stacks on top of an adapter which is plugged into the last drive in the chain.
