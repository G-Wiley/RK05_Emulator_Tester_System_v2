Diablo Adapter S v2
The Diablo Adapter S v2 is an adapter between the DEC dual 40-pin flat cable drive bus and the 42-pin connectors on the back of Diablo Series 30 disk drives. This adapter has sockets so it plugs into the connector with pins on the Diablo drive. The Diablo Terminator can be plugged into the Diablo Adapter that's attached to the last drive of the chain.
<p>This socket version of the adapter requires an authentic Winchester MRAC42S connector with jackscrews to be soldered to the PCB
